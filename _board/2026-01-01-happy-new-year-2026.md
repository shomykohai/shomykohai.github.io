Hi Shomy(I guess thats your real name) I wish you a very happy new year, may this year bring you exciting GitHub projects, steady progress, and results you’re truly proud of.

Also, I am curious about how you do all this, have you done any courses on reverse engineering and are/were you a CS student ?
