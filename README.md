## Posting on the board

To create a new post on the board, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `_board` directory in the repository.
2. Create a new markdown file with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`. (YES, YYYY-MM-DD, DEAL WITH IT ;3)
3. Add the following front matter at the top of the file:
```yaml
---
author: Your Name
author_pfp: URL to your profile picture
author_link: URL to your profile or website
---
```
4. Write your post content below the front matter using markdown syntax.
5. Open a pull request to merge your post into the website.

Example:
```markdown
---
author: Shomy
author_pfp: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61943525?v=4
author_link: https://github.com/shomykohai
